# backend caching strategies with redis [ai generated]

In backend development, caching with Redis can significantly reduce database load and improve response times. However, to avoid stale data or wasted memory, it's important to apply the right caching strategies depending on your use case.

This guide covers practical strategies for when and how to cache data in Redis in backend applications.

---

## When to Cache

### 1. **Expensive Reads**

Cache data that is costly to compute or query from the database (e.g., large joins, aggregations).

### 2. **Frequently Accessed Data**

Cache data that is requested often, such as:

- User profiles
- Product listings
- Permissions/roles

### 3. **Slow External API Calls**

Store the results of 3rd-party API calls to reduce latency and rate limit issues.

---

## Cache Update Strategies

### 1. **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**

- Check Redis first.
- On cache miss, fetch from DB and set it in Redis.
- Invalidate/update Redis manually after DB write.

```elixir
# pseudo-code
cached = Redis.get(key)
if not cached:
    data = DB.query()
    Redis.set(key, data, ttl=60)
```

**Use When:** You want full control over what gets cached.

---

### 2. **Write-Through**

- On every DB write, update Redis immediately.

```elixir
# pseudo-code
DB.save(data)
Redis.set(key, data)
```

**Use When:** Data must be immediately reflected in cache.

---

### 3. **Write-Behind (Asynchronous)**

- Write to Redis first, and write to DB in the background (e.g., queue, worker).

```elixir
# pseudo-code
Redis.set(key, data)
Queue.push(data)
# Worker later persists to DB
```

**Use When:** You want low-latency writes and can tolerate delayed DB persistence.

---

### 4. **Time-based Expiry (TTL)**

- Set a TTL to auto-expire cache entries.

```elixir
Redis.set(key, data, ttl=300)
```

**Use When:** Data changes infrequently and stale data is acceptable.

---

### 5. **Event-based Invalidation**

- Invalidate cache explicitly when a DB change happens.

```elixir
# After user update
DB.update(user)
Redis.del("user:123")
```

**Use When:** You need precise cache invalidation.

---

## Patterns and Practices

### Namespace Your Keys

```
user:123
product:456:reviews
```

### Use JSON or Native Serialization

Avoid stringly-typed values that are hard to decode.

### Avoid Caching Nulls

Don't store empty or null values unless necessary. It wastes space and may hide real errors.

### Use a Cache Stampede Prevention Strategy

- Use \[**locking**] or \[**request coalescing**] to prevent multiple requests hitting the DB during cache miss.

### Compress Large Payloads

Use gzip or zlib if storing large JSON blobs.

## TTL Strategy Examples

| Data Type       | TTL        | Notes                         |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| User profile    | 5–15 mins  | Rarely changes                |
| Dashboard stats | 30–60 secs | Semi-real-time acceptable     |
| Product catalog | 5–10 mins  | Changes periodically          |
| API responses   | 1–10 mins  | Based on rate limit and usage |

---

## Summary

- Use **cache-aside** for flexible and simple caching.
- Use **write-through** when you need immediate cache consistency.
- Use **write-behind** for high-throughput write-heavy workloads.
- Always define a **TTL** unless you have strong invalidation logic.
- Combine strategies where appropriate (e.g. cache-aside + TTL).

Effective caching reduces latency, improves scalability, and lowers infrastructure costs—when used correctly.
